# Recipies to invoke docker from my windows box to build installers

## A few ways

- we used to have a step by step sequence here.
- then we went to RunReleaseBuilds.sh (we still have it checked in for the 1.0b8 release)
- but going forward, we'll probably just use github actions (if I need to run manaully, easy to manually follow that recipe)

... after this release, probably lose docs on other approachs and that script, and just document the github actions approach
