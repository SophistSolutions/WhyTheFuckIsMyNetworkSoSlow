# Docker Build Containers

There is no need to use this, but it can provide a quickstart to building WhyTheFuckIsMyNetworkSoSlow

Just create one or more of these docker images, and run them as in:

- `make docker-images`
- `docker run -it sophistsolutionsinc/whythefuckismynetworksosmall-debian-small`
  - then inside the docker container find a ReadMe.md, and follow its instructions to build (basically clone WhyTheFuckIsMyNetworkSoSlow and type make )
