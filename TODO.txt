>>>> REST API
	/Network-Interfaces

		LIST INTERFACES THERE

	/Networks (already working)
		BUT list pointer to network interfaces

	/Devices
		In here, list pointers to networks and pointers to network interfaces


	// THEN do API
		/Network-Interface/ID
		/Network/ID
		/Devices/ID

	and change default for /Network-Interfaces etc to "details=false" ,but with details=true, list what we do now
	and details=false, just the names.


	//// MAYBE then add APIs
	// to measure TIME BETWEEN NODES and TIME TO ADDRESS
	// AND MAYBE HAVE "MONTIORS - where we defifine set of links to montir and then can check back on historical
	values for those?"

		Run a tracert, and stop at the first public IP address. (or navigate to www.sophists.com, and www.google.com, and grab meet of two paths)

		Maybe option for two notions of internet

		>	Take that function - and somehow expopse it as REST WS API
			grab current value, and keep running in background - every 5 minutes, and report statistics

		>	This is a very primitive first draft/try - but the starting point for collecting stats
